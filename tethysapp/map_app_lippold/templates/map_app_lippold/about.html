    <p style="width:50%;">I'm a senior in the civil engineering program, and I'll be graduating in June. I served my mission in Argentina, and started at BYU as soon as I got home. I've been married to my wife Michelle for two and a half years, and she actually helped introduce me to the Hydroinformatics lab where I've been working for almost two years.</p>

        <li>Data Services will be a page that talks about the data services you have used in your map, how you created the data, where you are hosting the data, what data is included, and any additional data about your data. Also include a link to the geoserver2 data view page for your data.</li>
        <li>About - the about page will include a picture of you, a link to send you an email, and a little bit about who you are.</li>
